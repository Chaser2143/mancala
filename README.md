NOTE: Game is not functional yet. Started developing yesterday, it still have a ways to go.

First attempt at an object oriented implementation of Mancala, purely for my own learning.

Not planning on a fancy UI (using print statements in Python).

Looking forward to developing a variety of AI profiles to play against.
